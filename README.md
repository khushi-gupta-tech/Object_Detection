# Object_Detection

# Overview
This project implements object detection using deep learning techniques. It can identify and classify multiple objects in images or real-time video streams. Pre-trained models like YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Detector), or Faster R-CNN are utilized for accurate and efficient detection.

# Features
. Detects multiple objects in images and videos with bounding boxes and labels.

. Uses pre-trained deep learning models for robust detection.

. Real-time object detection using a webcam or external camera.

. Easy-to-use interface for uploading images and viewing results.
